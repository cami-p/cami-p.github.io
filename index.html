                        Hi, I'm Camille Pon (she/her), a first-year computer science major at UC Irvine! I'm learning Python and completing the third course in the introductory to intermediate Python sequence this quarter. I also participate in on-campus clubs such as WICS (Women in Information Computer Science) and ICSSC (ICS Student Council). I enjoy problem solving and hope to learn a lot about the different applications of computer science.
                    </p>
